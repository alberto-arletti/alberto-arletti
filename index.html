  <p>Welcome to my personal academic webpage. I am Alberto Arletti, I am a Social Statistician.<br><br>
  
  Currently, I am part of the “So.Sta.” team under the supervision of Prof. Stefano Campostrini at Ca’ Foscari the University of Venice. There, as part of the larger Age-It Spoke 10 project, I currently work on healthy aging and populations, with a focus on the compression of morbidity comparing the Italian and U.S. populations.<br><br>
  
  In addition, I enjoy studying methods for survey methodology and my research interest focuses on non-ignorable selection bias (or MNAR) adjustment methods. As part of my PhD dissertation, I compared different avenues for bias adjustment in case of non-ignorable non-response, spending part of my PhD at the Institute for Social Research under the supervision of Prof. Yajuan Si. <br><br>
